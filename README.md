You will be able to find the deliverable within the attached ipynb file. This code will merge the two necessary dataframes and group the data as we are asked to do. 

The combined data allows for a deeper insight into which schools performed better than others with respect to funding per student. 

One of the biggest statistics that the model uncovered was that a distric school has a much lower percentage of students that had 70% or above for both math and reading. 
            
            Charter school: 95.10%
            District school: 73.67%
 
I would be sending my kid to a charter school.

The other statistic that surprised me was that the per student budget actually had a negaitve correlation with student success. 
The schools that had the highest per student budget actually had the lowest percentage of students that had above a 70% in both math and reading. 
With that being said, there is not a wide range of per student funding so this data conclusion is not very concrete, more schools would need to be looked at.

Another result that makes a little more sense is that a school with 2000 students or less will have a much better overall passing % (>70% math & reading). 
over 95% of the students in schools with less than 2000 students had scores higher than 70% in math and reading compared to 76.36% in schools with >2000 students.

Take a look through the file that has been uploaded to see the Dataframes that I have taken this info from
